## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### **Navigation Structure**
```
CustomerStack (Stack Navigator)
├── CustomerTabs (Bottom Tab Navigator)
│   ├── Products (ProductCatalogScreen)
│   ├── Cart (CartScreen)  
│   ├── My Orders (OrderHistoryScreen)
│   └── Profile (CustomerProfileScreen)
└── ProductDetail (ProductDetailScreen)
```

### **Key Components**
- **ProductCatalogScreen**: Main shopping interface with categories and search
- **ProductDetailScreen**: Detailed product view with specifications
- **CartScreen**: Shopping cart (ready for cart functionality)
- **OrderHistoryScreen**: Order management (ready for order data)
- **CustomerProfileScreen**: User profile with logout functionality

### **Dependencies Added**
- `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`: Bottom tab navigation
- `react-native-vector-icons`: Consistent iconography
- `@types/react-native-vector-icons`: TypeScript support

## 🚀 Current State
- ✅ Authentication working (development mode - login required each time)
- ✅ Customer navigation complete
- ✅ Product browsing with categories
- ✅ Product detail views
- ✅ User interface polished and responsive
- 🔄 Ready for cart and order functionality implementation

## 📱 User Flow
1. User logs in → Goes directly to **Products** tab
2. User browses categories (Fresh Fish, Seafood, Frozen, Ready to Cook)
3. User searches for specific products
4. User taps product → Views detailed information
5. User can navigate to Cart, Orders, or Profile as needed
6. User can logout from Profile screen

The customer interface is now clean, focused, and ready for the next phase of development (cart functionality, order management, and backend integration).
